# !!Important Announcement for 02.12.2024: K8StreamBot Sunset on December 10, 2024!!
We regret to inform our valued users that K8StreamBot will be officially sunset on December 10, 2024. This decision comes as a result of ongoing challenges between the software's owner and K8, which have unfortunately made continued support and development untenable.

We understand the impact this may have on your workflow, and we want to assure you that we are committed to providing full support until the sunset date. After December 10, 2024, K8StreamBot will no longer be available for use or receive any further updates.

We sincerely thank you for your support and loyalty throughout the years. Please feel free to reach out to our team with any questions or for assistance in transitioning to alternative solutions.

Thank you for being part of the K8StreamBot community.

Sincerely, The AxiomLab Team
